There are many different terms in the field of information technology. However, we only need to know some of them, only the essential ones. Information technology has become so big that it equals the medical sector, if not already surpasses it. The number of programming languages, functions, protocols, different procedures, areas of application, details, and at the same time, the number of errors that can occur. All these areas are so large that you can specialize your entire career in 1-2 areas.
