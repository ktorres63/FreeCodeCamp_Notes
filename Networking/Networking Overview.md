A network wnables 2 computers to communicate with each other.There is a wide array of **topologies** (mesh,tree,star), **mediums** (ethernet,fiber,coax, wireless) and **protocols** (TCP,UDP,IPX), that can be used to facilitate the network.

Suppose we imagine as a scenario that we want to visit a company's website from our "Home Network" in that case, we exchange data with the company's website located in their "Company Network". As we sending mail or packets, we know the address where the packets should go. The websites address or **Uniform Resource Locator (URL)** which we enter into our browser is also known as **Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDM)**
The difference between URLs and FQDNs is that:

+ An FQDN (www.hackthebox.eu) only specifies the address of the "building" and
- An URL (https://www.hackthebox.eu/example?floor=2&office=dev&employee=17) also specifies the "floor," "office," "mailbox" and the corresponding "employee" for whom the package is intended.
