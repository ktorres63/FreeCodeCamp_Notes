The network layer (layer 3) of OSI controls the exchange of data packets, as these cannot be directly routed to the receiver and therefore to be provided with routing nodes. The data packets are then transferred from node to node until they reach their target
In short, it is responsible for the following functions:
+ Logical Addressing
+ Routing
Protocols are defined in each layer of OSI, and these protocols represent a collection of rules for communication in the respective layer. They are transparent to the protocols of the Ã±ayers abpve or below. Some protocols fulfill tasks of several layers and extends over two or more layers. The most used protocols on this layer are
+ IPv4 / IPv6
+ IPsec
+ ICMP
+ IGMP
+ RIP
+ OSPF
It ensures the routing of packets from source to destination within or outside a subnet. These 2 subnets may have different  addressing schemes or incompatible addressing types. In both cases, the data transmission in each case goes through the entire communication network and incudes routing between the network nodes.
